# Setup
The setup below works on a UNIX like system. Windows should work in a similar fashion. Just give it a quick google.
```bash
python3 -m venv <directory name>
source <directory name>/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
The dataset should be stored in a foldler called `local_work` and all images should reside is a child folder called `all_imgs`. These names can also be adjusted in the config file. You can read more about the dataset in the corresponding section below.

# Datasets

# Training

# Testing
Testing is implemented using the `unittest` module of python. You can simply call the two python files prefixed with `test_` to run the tests.
